            Like the mighty oxen, I must eat semi-regularly or I will die. When I was young, I would only eat tuna fish. My mother got around this by saying,
            <ul>
                <li>this is steak tuna fish</li>
                <li>this is broccoli tuna fish</li>
                <li>this is tomato soup tuna fish</li>
            </ul>
            This was my first taste of betrayal.

            I am also a big metal fan. I am too intimidated by the passion of other metal fans to announce this in public, but for the purposes of this quiz, remember that when there's lightning, you know it never brings me down. Cause it's free and I see that it's me who is lost and never found. Thirty years after playing with a band named "Elf", Ronnie James Dio recorded a single entitled, "Slaying the Dragon". Dio knew exactly who he was and he never apologized for that. I want to be like Dio. Sorry! Wait, dang it. I messed up.

            My martial arts journey began with Kempo karate at the age of 7, and after a year I thought I was ready to challenge two bullies in a noble bout of fisticuffs. Hilariously, they took me down and hit me repeatedly. Then I studied Jeet Kune Do, Bruce Lee's martial philosophy, transitioned into MMA, and finally fell in love with the national sport of Thailand, Muay Thai. All in all, I have studied different martial arts for 18+ years! If you need to distract me to pick my pocket or let your sidekick sneak past me to disable the security cameras I am guarding, just ask for an opinion on the relative merits of:
            <ol>
                <li>bare knuckle boxing versus knockdown karate</li>
                <li>big gloves versus little gloves</li>
                <li>headbutting versus eye gouging</li>
                <li>angry shouting versus gentle hugging</li>
                <li>toad style versus almost any weapon</li>
            </ol>
